# Lightning Experience Development

### Page-centric web application model = Salesforce Classic
  * it relies on the server to generate a new page every time you interact with the application
  * Visualforce framework provides a robust set of tags that are resolved on the server, and that work alongside standard or custom controllers to make database and other operation simple to implement.
  
### App-centric model
 * Javascript is used to create, modify, transform, and animate the UI rather than completely replacing it a page at a time.
